# Basic HTML Website

## Description
This project is part of the roadmap.sh frontend path. The goal is to build a simple, multi-page website using only HTML, focusing on proper structure and semantics. The website includes a homepage, projects page, articles page, and a contact page, all linked via a consistent navigation bar. Styling is intentionally omitted to concentrate on the foundational HTML structure.

## Goals
- Learn how to create a website with multiple interconnected pages.
- Structure a website using semantic HTML5 elements.
- Create a layout that is ready for future CSS styling.
- Add essential SEO meta tags to each page for better search engine visibility.

## Implementation Notes
- The website consists of four pages: Homepage, Projects, Articles, and Contact.
- A navigation bar is present on all pages, allowing users to move between them.
- The focus is purely on semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`). No CSS is used.
- The contact page should include a form for user inquiries.

## What I Learned
- How to create and link multiple HTML pages to form a cohesive website.
- The importance of using semantic HTML tags to define the structure of a webpage (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- How to add page-specific SEO meta tags (`description`, `keywords`) to improve search engine ranking.
- Structuring content logically within sections, preparing it for future styling with CSS.
