# Changelog Component

## Description
This project focuses on creating a simple, responsive changelog component using HTML and CSS. A changelog displays a chronological list of notable changes, updates, and improvements made to a project or software. The goal is to master CSS positioning, layout techniques, and responsive design principles.

## Goals
- Create a visually appealing timeline-style changelog component
- Practice CSS positioning and layout techniques (Grid, Flexbox)
- Implement responsive design that works across different screen sizes
- Build a reusable component that can be easily integrated into any website
- Focus on semantic HTML structure and accessibility

## Implementation Notes
- **Structure**: Used semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<time>`) for better accessibility
- **Layout**: Implemented CSS Grid for the timeline structure with proper alignment
- **Styling**: Used CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming and easy customization
- **Timeline Design**: Created a vertical timeline with markers and connecting lines
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile-first approach with media queries for smaller screens
- **Typography**: System font stack for optimal performance and readability

- How to create timeline layouts using CSS Grid and positioning
