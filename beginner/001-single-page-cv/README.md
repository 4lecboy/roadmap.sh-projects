# Single Page CV (HTML Only)

This project is part of the roadmap.sh frontend path. The goal is to build a structured, single-page CV using only semantic HTML, with basic SEO and social sharing readiness. Styling will be added in a later project.

## Goals
- Create a clear, semantic layout for education, skills, and career history.
- Add essential SEO meta tags and Open Graph tags.
- Link a favicon.

## Implementation Notes
- Use semantic elements: header, main, section, article, h1–h3, ul/ol, footer.
- Keep one HTML page with clearly separated sections: Education, Skills, Career History.
